# Tech-Store-Managment-System
Project for CEN 213 - OOP
This is the end of semester project for the CEN 213 - Object Oriented Programming class.
The idea was to create a simple tech managment system with 3 levels of access: Cashier, Manager and Administrator each with its own funcionalities.
Language used was Java with implementation of JavaFX to handle the GUI.

-------------------------------- WHAT I LEARNED ----------------------------------------
- Working in a larger scale projects (largest project i worked on so far) requires a lot of planning and organizing
- MVC (model view controller) architecture
- Working on passing neccessary information around views 

-------------------------------- NEXT STEPS --------------------------------------------
- Replace binary i/o with actual databases like SQL
- Refactor code to remove unnecessary parts and generalize some of the classes in order to reuse them
